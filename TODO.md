# TODO
Here are the improvements I would like to make before advertising:
- Make a mini how-to guide on home-page

- Get LXX from openscriptures/GreekResources/LxxLemmas
- Get WLC from openscriptures/morphhb/wlc (including versification!)...and has all lemmas + strongs!
   ...run their perl script!
- For Hebrew: wwitch to using strongs dictionaries from openscriptures/strongs/hebrew
- For Greek: do the same...but get mapping from GreekResources/GreekWordList.js
   ...also something to do with http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/

And less important ones
- Check create_translations script is still valid
- Search for words with root
