# TODO
Here are the improvements I would like to make before advertising:
- Fix searching (including english searches)
- Add number of times used for each strongs reference
- Fix search to not say "in Tanakh" but "in Bible or LXX" where appropriate
- Tidy up home.html
- Figure out how to get to Greek lemmas and therefore correct strongs numbers

And less important ones
- Check create_translations script is still valid
